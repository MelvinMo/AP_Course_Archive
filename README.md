## Programming Mini Projects
This folder contains an extensive collection of over twenty meticulously crafted C++ codes, encompassing a wide range of topics and functionalities within the language. Each mini-project serves as an opportunity to delve into different aspects of C++, including object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## Final Exam
In the programming section of the final exam for the course, I analyzed and visualized real-world data sets using vector variables and bar chart visualizations. I demonstrated my proficiency by writing functions to manipulate the data within the vectors, including adding, removing, and sorting values. These functions efficiently modified both the underlying data structures and the corresponding bar charts. Notably, I accomplished this task using C++ during my first year as a student.
